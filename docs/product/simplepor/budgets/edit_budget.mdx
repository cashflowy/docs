You can edit the budget at any time. You can edit any field of a budget. Typically budgets are editted under the following circumstances:

- typo mistake while creating budget
- changes in budget amount as part of strategic decision 
- change in approvers or owner for the budget

#### while updating budget approver

When you update budget approver, existing PORs that are not yet approved will be affected. They will continue to have the previous approver. PORs created from now onwards will have the new approver flow.
