Vendors are people/organisation that you purchase items from. If your vendor does not exist on POR yet, you need to create the vendor before you create the POR. 

Most of the details of the vendor that you feed into the POR app is so that you can communicate the details of the vendor effectively with the finance team. As the buyer, you migth be interacting with your vendor more than the finance team. So changes in details of the vendors are better captured here by the buyer.
