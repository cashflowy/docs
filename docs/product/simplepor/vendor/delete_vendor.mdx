You can delete a vendor, only if there is no PORs created against this vendor. If you are no longer working with a vendor and wants to move them out of sight, you can [archive the vendor](/product/simplepor/vendor/archive_vendor). 

If you want to temporarily stop creating PORs against a specific vendor, you can [disable the vendor](/product/simplepor/vendor/disable_vendor).
