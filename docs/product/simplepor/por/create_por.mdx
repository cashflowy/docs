## Reimbursement

Lets say you have already made the payment for incidental expenses that you are approved to make. SimplePOR also allows you to to make PORs for your reimbursements. 

When you are creating your POR, set payment option as `Reimbursement`. Once the PO is approved, your finance team will pay you instead of paying the vendor. 


## Add attachment

Typical finance process requires users to submit invoices along with the PO. You can attach a Performa invoice or the actual Invoice to the POR. This helps the finance team reconcile the POs, Invoices and Payments. 


## Add comments

Comment section on each POR helps you with 2 things:
- communicate with the stakeholders about any issues with the POR
- add information specific to the POR that you want to refer to later
