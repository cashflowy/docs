Purhcase Order Request(POR) is not exactly a Purchase Order(PO). Once a POR is approved it becomes a PO. Depending on your companies finance operation practices, the reference number sequence of a POR can be different from reference number sequence of PO. Some companies choose to use the same sequence, while others use a different sequence. 

The easiest way to setup POR app is to use the same sequence. One POR maps to one PO. In which case, you can think of a POR = PO. 

SimplePOR(a.k.a Cashflowy POR app) simplifies the approval workflow for creating POs.
