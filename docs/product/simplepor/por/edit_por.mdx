Users can edit every field in a POR except the budget. The reason for this is that the POR might be in the middle of the approval process. If you created the POR with the wrong budget, then you will have to withdrew the POR, duplicate the POR with the new budget. 

If the POR is pending approval, user can edit a POR. Once a POR is approved, rejected or cancelled(withdrawn), it cannot be editted.
