Business owners have decisions to make. To make decisions, they need to understand their financial health. They need to model their finances. They need to model different scenarios. 

As a small business, cash is almost always a constraint. Having company financials at your finger tips is a super power that most business owners wish they had. 


### But there is a problem
Having accurate, updated financials requires either 
- business owners to understand accounting deeply or
- accountant to understand business owners data requirements or
- data engineer to to understand both accounting and owners data requirement. 

The problem is
- most business owners dont have time to understand accountant's data structure 
- most accountants dont understand business owners data requirements or the data ETLs or transformations required
- most data engineers find finance/accounting really complex or less exciting that building a customer facing product. 

Every company eventually address this problem when they grow big enough. A lot of small business die before they get to this point. We think a lot of SMBs would have made it big if they just had this super power - "your business financials live and accurate at your finger tips".
