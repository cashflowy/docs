At its core, reports are financial data presented in a meaningful format so that you can consume the info and more importantly act on it. 

Reports help you: 
- understand what is going on. 
- make decisions. 

Cashflowy provides a number of report templates. These are templates that we believe will help you make better decisions. These report templates have been formatted for easier consumption of the underlying data. These templates are also linked with jobs so that the data is updated fresh from your source of data(accounting tools or payment gateways etc).
