## How it works 
- Cashflowy gets all accounting transactions with account_group set as income from zoho books. This data is stored in the sheet - `account_transactions`
- In sheet - `Sales by Account`, using Excel formulaes, the data is presented in a tabular format with months along the x-axis and account name along the y-axis. This helps you see your income split and trend over the months. 
- In sheet - `Sales by Customer`, you can see your sales distribution split by customer.
- To help you visualise this better, the `summary` sheet has a chart.
