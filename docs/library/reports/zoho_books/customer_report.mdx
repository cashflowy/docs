## Purpose 
This report helps with your customer reconciliation process. Typically when working with various customers, confusions arise in terms of invoicing done or payments made. This can become complex if the payment cycles are more than 30 days, making it hard to track payments against invoices. This reports exports data exclusively for one customer so that you can share this with your customer. This enables you to reconcile with the customer's accounts team faster. 

This report is similar to [Vendor report](/library/reports/zoho_books/vendor_report).
