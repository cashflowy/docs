## Purpose 
If your book keeping process is not reliable, your financial data also becomes unreliable. T-1(pronouced as "T minus one") book keeping is a practice that companies adopt to improve their book keeping practice. T-1 means books are closed within one day every day. I.e. today, the books are accurate up to yesterday. T-X, `X` represents how many days after do you close the books or pass the entry. 

Implementing T-1 practice for small business is hard. It requires additional staff and extra attention. This report will give you a sense of how bad your book keeping process is. It gives you an objective metric that you can use to keep your book keeping team accountable.

e.g. you can instruct your book keeping team that, invoices should be recorded in the books within 3 days. 90% of the bills should be recorded in the books within 30 days. 

Taking a look at your T minus report will also give you business owner, how much you can trust the data in the other reports.

## How it works 
- This report tracks 8 objects. So this report has 8 jobs. Even if you dont use all 8 objects, we recommend tracking the first 5 - namely - bills, expenses, vendor_payments, invoices, customer_payments
- Cashflowy jobs gets data from zoho books for the above 8 objects and puts them into individual sheets. 
- T minus is calculated using excel formulaes in `common` sheet.
- That information is consolidated in `t_minus` sheet
- `t_minus` sheet shows the following information
  - count - number of transactions
  - min - min value of t-minus
  - max - max value of t-minus
  - avg - average value of t-minus
  - standard deviation - how much variation is present in the t-minus


For small business, we recommend, your books closed within 7 days. If your Tminus score is less than 30 it is still doable. You need to work on getting the number lower if possible. Tminus score more than 30 needs immediate attention.
