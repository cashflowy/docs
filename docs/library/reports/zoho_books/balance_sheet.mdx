This report fetchs data from zoho books and shows it as it is. This is useful for getting a quick sense of the numbers and a sense of grouping of the chart of accounts. Typically this report is not used as a final output. It is used to getting a reference to build your own custom Balance sheet based on how you like to group your chart of accounts. This report acts as a reference to bench mark against. 

If you want to make your own custom balance_sheet(as in organise the line items that best suits your business..) use the

## How it works 
- Cashflowy gets all accounting transactions with account_group set as expense from zoho books. This data is stored in the sheet - `accounting_transactions`
- In sheet - `Report`, using Excel formulaes, the data is presented in a tabular format with months along the x-axis and account name along the y-axis. This helps you see your expense split and trend over the months. 
- To help you visualise this better, the `summary` sheet has a chart.
