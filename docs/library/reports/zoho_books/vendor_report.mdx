## Purpose 
This report helps with your vendor reconciliation process. Typically when working with various vendors, confusions arise in terms of invoicing done or payments made. This can become complex if the payment cycles are more than 30 days, making it hard to track payments against invoices. This reports exports data exclusively for one vendor so that you can share this with your vendor. This enables you to reconcile with the vendor's accounts team faster. 

This report is similar to [Customer report](/library/reports/zoho_books/customer_report).
