## How it works 
- Cashflowy gets all bills from zoho books. This data is stored in the sheet - `bills`
- In sheet - `Report`, using Excel formulaes, the data is presented in a tabular format with months along the x-axis and account name along the y-axis. This helps you see your bill split and trend over the months. 
- To help you visualise this better, the `summary` sheet has a chart.
